            <p style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 3px; font-size: 24px;"><b>Why use a collection agency?</b></p>
            <p class="heigh">There are many advantages to using the services of a <span style="text-decoration: underline">collection agency</span>. More often than not, a consumer will cooperate with a collection agency, even if they have not been cooperative with you. This is because most understand that collection agencies may affect their credit history along with employing other methods, such as legal action, to secure payment. The bottom line is that you are busy enough trying to perform your other functions to have to waste time tracking down customers who haven’t paid their bills. Let <span style="font-size:20px;"><b>McCracken Stoll & Associates</b></span> handle the process of debt collection, saving your business the aggravation, so that you can work on growing your business.</p>

            <span><img style="display: inline-block;" src="./images/hand.png"></span>
            <p style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 3px; font-size: 24px;"><b>What’s in it for you?</b></p>
            <p class="heigh">Various factors will determine our fee (i.e. age, type, balance size). However, our typical compensation involves contingency fees of between 15% and 30%. Contingency fees ensure that your company is not throwing good money after bad; we are only paid if we are successful! Compare this to other agencies that charge an upfront fee and require you to place a specified number of accounts on a monthly or annual basis. At <span style="font-size:20px;"><b>McCracken Stoll & Associates</b></span> our contracts do not contain any quotas or minimums!</p>


            <span><img style="display: inline-block;" src="./images/hand.png"></span>
            <p style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 3px; font-size: 20px;"><b>What is <span style="font-size:24px;"><b>McCracken Stoll & Associates</b></span> success rate been with other companies?</b></p>
            <p class="heigh">We take pride in our proven system and our results speak for themselves. We have consistently realized recovery rates that are, in most cases, equal to or above industry average across a broad range of industries and debt types. With ourcustomer service approach to collecting on outstanding debt we have overcome this unique challenge by working with the consumer to establish a re-payment plan that they can afford.</p>


            <span><img style="display: inline-block;" src="./images/hand.png"></span>
            <p style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 3px; font-size: 20px;"><b>When should your practice consider turning over an account to a <span style="font-size: 24px;"><b>collection agency</b></span>?</b></p>
            <p class="heigh">As soon as you believe repayment of debt is in doubt. The longer you wait, the less chance there is of the money reaching your hands. If they haven’t responded to your first late notice, the best way to ensure you will be paid in the future is to send the account to us. As more time elapses, studies show that it becomes less and less likely that the debt will ever be recovered. Other variables on collectability include, but are not limited to, the type of debt, documentation, balance, and industry. However, the biggest variable that you have control over is the amount of time that has passed since they have become past due. Don’t delay any longer, start getting paid today!</p>

            <span><img style="display: inline-block;" src="./images/hand.png"></span>
            <p style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 3px; font-size: 20px;"><b>How quickly can <span style="font-size:24px;"><b>McCracken Stoll & Associates</b></span> collect your money?</b></p>
            <p class="heigh">Claims are entered in our collection system immediately and the person responsible for the unpaid debt is notified shortly thereafter both by phone and mail. Our proven system includes a phone call campaign, email notifications (if available), and a letter series. Some debts can be collected within the first few days while others may take longer. Our goal is to get you paid within 90 days.</p>


            <span><img style="display: inline-block;" src="./images/hand.png"></span>
            <p style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 3px; font-size: 24px;"><b>How soon will you get paid after the money has been collected?</b></p>
            <p class="heigh">All payments are immediately deposited into a state-regulated client trust account. The net amount due to your company on payments made, in any single month, are sent to you on the 10th of the following month. However, if a debtor pays you directly in response to our collection efforts, you must notify us immediately so that proper credit can be given to your customer. We will bill you directly for these fees.</p>

            <span><img style="display: inline-block;" src="./images/hand.png"></span>
            <p style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 3px; font-size: 20px;"><b>What communication will you have with <span style="font-size:24px;"><b>McCracken Stoll & Associates</b></span> ?</b></p>
            <p class="heigh">We pride ourselves on strong relationships with our clients. This means that you will receive monthly collection reports, which give detail on the collection process.</p>

            <span><img style="display: inline-block;" src="./images/hand.png"></span>
            <p style="display: inline-block; margin-left: 3px; font-size: 24px;"><b>What happens if the debtor refuses to pay?</b></p>
            <p class="heigh">We will keep detailed and accurate reports regarding all your accounts. Therefore, if consumers continuously refuse to pay our office will assess whether the situation is worthy of legal action. If legal action is appropriate, we will front attorney fees and manage the entire litigation process.</p>


            <span><img style="display: inline-block;" src="./images/hand.png"></span>

            <p class="heigh">Many people view collection agencies as one step away from mafia hit men, but this is really not the case.
